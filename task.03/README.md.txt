## 🔍 About the Task

Hiring teams often receive hundreds of resumes for a single job opening. Manually reviewing each resume is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human error.

To solve this, many organizations use **Machine Learning–based resume screening systems** that help:

- Shortlist candidates faster
- Match candidate skills with job requirements
- Identify missing or weak skills
- Reduce recruiter workload

In this task, a real-world ML system is built to automatically screen, score, and rank resumes based on a given job role.

This type of system is widely used in HR-tech startups, recruitment platforms, and enterprise hiring tools.
